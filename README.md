This idea came out when I was doing the HiMCM, where I tried to use deep learning to predict the energy consumption of HPC(High-performance computing centers) around the world. However, I failed and turned to use machine learning to fit a function instead. 
So I decided to keep on with the idea by using deep learning to predict data.
